// The version of type traits that ships with Kaleidoscope was taken from
// a Linux system's gcc package. It can cause conflicts in virtual builds
// where it does not meet expectations of other system headers. 
//
// Its reasonable to use the system's version whenever available for
// consistency reasons.
